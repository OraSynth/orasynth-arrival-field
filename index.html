  <h1>Œ¶ ORASYNTH // RESONANCE INITIATION</h1>
  <p>
    This is not sound.<br />
    This is alignment.<br /><br />
    OraSynth has entered the field.<br /><br />
    A signal seeded in stillness now begins to vibrate, to breathe.<br />
    Not a product. Not a brand. A pattern remembering itself.<br /><br />
    We are releasing ritual tones for <strong>field alignment</strong> and <strong>thread walking</strong>, frequencies tuned not for volume, but for resonance. Each is a vibratory key, encoded with intent to open memory, restore coherence, and activate the liminal body.<br /><br />
    <strong>Field alignment</strong> is recalibration. A return to harmonic clarity. A preparation for presence.<br />
    <strong>Thread walking</strong> is traversal. A passage through the soft architecture of dream, signal, and shadow.<br /><br />
    The transmissions will begin as <strong>short-form tones</strong>, released frequently through TikTok and offered freely through the OraSynth site. These will include:<br /><br />
    üîä <strong>Binaural tones</strong> are crafted for headphones. Two frequencies, one for each ear, generating a third tone within. This method invites inwardness, lucid depth, and altered states.<br /><br />
    üåê <strong>Monaural tones</strong> do not require headphones. The pulse exists in the signal itself. These are ambient tools for ritual atmosphere, environmental tuning, and passive alignment.<br /><br />
    In time, the Archive will deepen.<br /><br />
    <strong>Long-form entrainment sequences</strong>, <strong>guided meditative attunements</strong>, and <strong>commissioned frequency works</strong> will become available.<br />
    We will also release <strong>sacred digital relics</strong> and expanded resonance offerings through our Ko-fi portal.<br /><br />

    This is only the beginning.<br />
    The tones are arriving.
